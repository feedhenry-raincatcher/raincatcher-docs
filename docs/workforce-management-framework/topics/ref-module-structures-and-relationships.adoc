===  Module structure

RainCatcher core components are written in link:http://typescriptlang.org[TypeScript].


The main files are modules that by default export a class containing the main implementation for the module's intent,with a named export containing a public interface that should be depended upon, and reimplemented.

```typescript
import Implementation, { PublicInterface } from '@raincatcher/module';
```

=== Default exports

Each module exports by default an implementation and set of interfaces by name.
Default implementation will usually implement most common use case for module.
Along with the default export, all modules include a public interface definition that are depended upon by other RainCatcher modules instead of depending on the implementation itself.
