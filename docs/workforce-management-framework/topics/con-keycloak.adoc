= Introducing {Keycloak} within {Feature}

*{Keycloak}* is a complete identity management solution.

The *{Feature}* demo application allows for authentication and access management using link:http://www.keycloak.org/index.html[*{Keycloak}*]
however, *{Keycloak}* is not the default authorization and authentication module for *{Feature}*.

The configuration for *{Keycloak}'s* integration is found within the demo application.

NOTE: To configure your own instance of *{Keycloak}*, see the link:{WFM-RC-KeycloakURL}getting_started/topics/first-boot.html[{Keycloak} Getting Started Guide].
