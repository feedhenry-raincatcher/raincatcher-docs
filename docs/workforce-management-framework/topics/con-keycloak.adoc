= Introducing {Keycloak} within {PROJECT_NAME}

*{Keycloak}* is a complete identity management solution.

The *{PROJECT_NAME}* demo application allows for authentication and access management using link:http://www.keycloak.org[*{Keycloak}*]
however, *{Keycloak}* is not the default authorization and authentication module for *{PROJECT_NAME}*.

The configuration for *{Keycloak}'s* integration is found within the demo application.

NOTE: To configure your own instance of *{Keycloak}*, see the {Keycloak} documentation Getting Started Guide.
