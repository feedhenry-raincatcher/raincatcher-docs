= {PROJECT_NAME} Mobile Application

The Mobile Application is Angular.js based and it provides an interface for field operators.
A solution based on {PROJECT_NAME} can be extended by providing additional UI elements, themes and functionality.

== Local Development

To install the Portal Application, execute `npm install`.

== Running on a Browser

Install all project dependencies and run the following commands to test the application in a local browser:

`npm start`

or

`grunt serve:local --url=http://localhost:8001`

Ensure the `url` parameter is the root of the API server application running the API endpoints.
For more information on how to run a server, see the xref::{context}-ref-server[server side documentation].
