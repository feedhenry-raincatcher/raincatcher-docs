= Working with the *{Feature}* Application

The *{Feature}* Application consists of three components:

- A *Mobile Application* for end users
- A *Portal Application* for administrator users and accessed through a web browser
- A *Cloud Application* for backend server functionality (there is no user interface)

An administrator can define a business process or procedure via a custom _Workflow_.
A _Workflow_ contains one to many _Steps_.
A _Workorder_ is an individual instance of a _Workflow_ and it (the _Workorder_) is assigned to an end user (or to many end users) as a job that they are to complete.
An end user can view their _Workorder_ via a *Mobile Application*.
An administrator can manage the _Workorder_ via the *Portal Application*.

The *{Feature}* Application is supplied with demo users and data, and both are used to assist a User when demonstrating *{Feature}* functionality.

== Working with the Portal Application

The Portal Application is used by an administrator to essentially manage the _Workorder_.
An administrator can view, edit and assign a _Workorder_ and also create a new _Workflow_.
When an administrator logs into the Portal Application, there are two separate areas that they can access on the Portal Application: the _Workflow_ and the _Workorder_.

.Available Areas on the Portal Application
|===
|Area |Functionality

|_Workflow_
|Create, read, update, delete and list operations can be executed against a _Workflow_.

Manage _Workflows_ and add additional _Steps_ to an existing _Workflow_.

|_Workorder_
|Create, read, update, delete and list operations can be executed against a _Workorder_.

Manage _Workorders_ by assigning them to individual end users.

|===

IMPORTANT: Once a _Workorder_ has been created, any _Workflows_ based in this _Workorder_ become unchangeable, that is, the sequence of _Steps_ that make up the _Workorder_ cannot be changed.

NOTE: Use the _Add Step screen_ to add additional steps to the _Workflow_.

=== Working with a Workflow

To make updates to a _Workflow_ or to delete a _Workflow_, use the the *pencil* (to update) or the *trash* (to delete) icons in the top right side of the screen.
Updating a _Workflow_ will increment the version of the _Workflow_ however, do note that any existing _Workorders_ that are based on the original _Workflow_ will continue to use the older version of the _Workorder_.
Naturally, a new _Workorder_ can be created and based on the incremented _Workflow_.

A _Step_ can be modified or deleted.
Use the *circle* with the plus icon to create a new _Workflow_.
This new _Workflow_ can be used to create or update _Workorders_.

Refresh the screen to see the new _Workflow_ appearing in the list in the center panel.
You can access existing _Workflows_ by selecting them in the list in the center panel.
The options presented for editing a _Workflow_ are the same for the creation of a _Workflow_.

=== Creating a Workorder

A _Workorder_ is an individual instance of a _Workflow_ and it can be assigned to an end user.
