=== Working with a Workflow

To make updates to a _Workflow_ or to delete a _Workflow_, use the the *pencil* (to update) or the *trash* (to delete) icons in the top right side of the screen.
Updating a _Workflow_ will increment the version of the _Workflow_ however, do note that any existing _Workorders_ that are based on the original _Workflow_ will continue to use the older version of the _Workorder_.
Naturally, a new _Workorder_ can be created and based on the incremented _Workflow_.

A _Step_ can be modified or deleted.
Use the *circle* with the plus icon to create a new _Workflow_.
This new _Workflow_ can be used to create or update _Workorders_.

Refresh the screen to see the new _Workflow_ appearing in the list in the center panel.
You can access existing _Workflows_ by selecting them in the list in the center panel.
The options presented for editing a _Workflow_ are the same for the creation of a _Workflow_.
