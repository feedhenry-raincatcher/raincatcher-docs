= Extending the User Interface

{PROJECT_NAME} framework provides a set of extension points that allows a developer to modify an Angular User Interface (UI).
You can modify the UI by writing additional modules that provide a set of the Angular.js directives to extend the Mobile and Portal UI.
The {PROJECT_NAME} Application is shipped with the `angularjs-extensions` example that extends the Mobile and Portal Applications:

 * https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-angularjs/tree/master/packages/angularjs-extensions

This Module contains the example directives that are used for demo purposes and it can be used as a template to extend the existing {PROJECT_NAME} UI.

== Extending the Workorders UI

By default, {PROJECT_NAME} provides a minimal set of defined fields for a _workorder_.
If your step results contain additional data, for example, gps location, an address or a description UI element, you probably want to extend the workorders UI to display that data.

=== Building Directives
To extend a _workorder_, implement two Angular Directives:

.Angular Directives for Extending a _workorder_
|===
|Angular Directive |Description

|`workorder-data`
|A Data directive used to implement static fields that display data.

|`workorder-data-edit`
|A Data-edit directive used to implement fields that allow modifications to be made to a _workorder's_ data.

|===

NOTE: Directives operate (with respect to existing fields) outside of a _workorder_ to avoid naming conflicts, for example, `workorder.data.yourcustomfield`

== User Interface

Include any required additional styles or libraries in the top level application.
The Mobile and Portal Applications contain standard bootstrap and Angular material directives and are located in the top level of the application.
For more information, see the link:https://material.angularjs.org/latest/api[Latest API].

== Development of a template

To build a template, use `grunt wfmTemplate:build`.
To rebuild a template after making changes to it, use `grunt wfmTemplate:watch`.
Each change to a template requires a distribution build.

== Integration

An _Entry File_ exposes a new implementation of an Angular module, mount it in a root application module.
Integrate any new NPM modules into both the Mobile and the Portal Application, so that the User can view the data belonging to the revised _workorder_.

NOTE: The {PROJECT_NAME} Application contains the `@raincatcher-examples/angularjs-extensions` module. If you require a new custom module, remove the {PROJECT_NAME} Application to avoid collisions.

== Publishing

For {PROJECT_NAME} to consume a module, best practice is to ensure that the module is published to the public or private NPM registry.
When publishing a custom module, ensure that the package's name and the author's name are updated.
If you choose not to publish a custom module, you can include all directives directly in the {PROJECT_NAME} application.
