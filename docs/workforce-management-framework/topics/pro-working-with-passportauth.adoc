== Configuration of PassportAuth module
The module is an out of the box security solution for default integration. PassportAuth uses JSON files that contain user data.
This user data contains sample users and access roles for demo purposes in the
link:{WFM-RC-CoreURL}{WFM-RC-Branch}/demo/server/src/modules/wfm-user/users.json[Demo Data].
The following procedure describes how to use a different user data source.

== Pointing PassportAuth to a Datasource

NOTE: _UserRepository_ requires user data containing a minimum of username and password to work.

. Implement the link:../../../api/{WFM-RC-Api-Version}{WFM-RC-Api-User-Repository}[UserRepository].

For an end to end implementation of the _UserRepository_ interface, see link:{WFM-RC-Github-Core}{WFM-RC-Branch}{WFM-RC-PassportAuth-Example}[PassportAuth-Example].
