= Introducing {PROJECT_NAME} Logging

*{PROJECT_NAME} Logging* is a facade for link:https://nodejs.org[Node.js] based applications and it is used by all {PROJECT_NAME} modules.
*{PROJECT_NAME} Logging* is contained in the `{PROJECT_NAME}-core` module.

Developers can use their own loggers by wrapping their implementation into the provided _logger interfaces_.
For more information about the _logger interface_ structure, see link:{WFM-RC-CoreURL}{WFM-RC-Branch}/common/logger/src/Logger.ts[Logger.ts]

The *{PROJECT_NAME}* demo application contains two implementations of the _logger interface_ and are found in the `{PROJECT_NAME}-core` module.
To see a logging example, see the link:{WFM-RC-CoreURL}{WFM-RC-Branch}/common/logger/example/index.ts[Cloud Logger example].
