= Logging Module

The {WFM-RC-NameLong} Logger Module is a logging facade for node.js based applications and it is used by all {WFM-RC-NameLong} modules.
The {WFM-RC-NameLong} Logger Module is is contained in the `raincatcher-core` module.

There are two implementations of the {WFM-RC-NameLong} Logger module, Bunyan and Console.
By default, the Bunyan and the Console implementations are not setup and so, no logging exists by default.
Users can use their own loggers by wrapping their logger into the provided class.
