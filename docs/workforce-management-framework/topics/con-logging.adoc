= Introducing {Feature} Logging

*{Feature} Logging* is a facade for link:https://nodejs.org[Node.js] based applications and it is used by all {Feature} modules.
*{Feature} Logging* is contained in the `{Feature}-core` module.

Developers can use their own loggers by wrapping their implementation into the provided _logger interfaces_.
For more information about the _logger interface_ structure, see link:{WFM-RC-CoreURL}{WFM-RC-Branch}/cloud/logger/src/Logger.ts[Logger.ts]

The *{Feature}* demo application contains two implementations of the _logger interface_ and are found in the `{Feature}-core` module.
To see a logging example, see the link:{WFM-RC-CoreURL}{WFM-RC-Branch}/cloud/logger/example/index.ts[Cloud Logger example].
