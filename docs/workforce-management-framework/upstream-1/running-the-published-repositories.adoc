= Running the Published Repositories for the Demo App
//Concepts
The {WFM-RC-NameShort} demo app comprises of three applications *Mobile*, *Portal* and a *Node.js Server*.
For testing and demo purposes, *Mobile* and *Portal* are launched in the browser.
*Mobile* can be built to run on a mobile phone.

These applications are also available in standalone repositories that point to published versions of the {WFM-RC-NameShort} packages.
Running the demo applications this ways provides a simpler and more stable alternative to users that only wish to test them locally in their machines,
without the extra concerns required only for a development setup.
