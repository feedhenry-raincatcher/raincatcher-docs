= Running the {WFM-RC-AppType1} Applications on a Local Machine

= Running the Published Repositories for the Demo App
//Concepts
The *{WFM-RC-NameShort}* {WFM-RC-AppType1} Apps from the _Published Repositories_ comprise of three applications:

* _Mobile_
* _Portal_
* _Node.js Server_

These applications are also available in standalone repositories that point to published versions of the {WFM-RC-NameShort} packages.
Running the demo applications as described in this section provides a simpler and more stable alternative to users that only wish to test them locally on their machines,
without the extra concerns required only for a development setup.
