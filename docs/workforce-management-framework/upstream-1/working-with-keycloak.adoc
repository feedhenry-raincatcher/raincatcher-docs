= Working With {WFM-RC-KeycloakName}

This section describes how to modify aspects of *{WFM-RC-KeycloakName}*.

//Concepts
The {WFM-RC-NameShort} Demo Application allows for authentication and access management using link:http://www.keycloak.org/index.html[{WFM-RC-KeycloakName}]

{WFM-RC-KeycloakName} integration is configured within the Demo Application.
