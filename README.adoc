== Building community edition

    gem install asciidoctor
    git checkout gh-pages
    cd docs/workforce-management-framework/upstream-1

    cp master.html ../../../index.html
    git commit -a -m"Pages update"
    git push origin +gh-pages

== Terminology

This template repository uses the terms below as defined:

title::
  A _title_ is a _deliverable_, i.e. a piece of content that is publishable using our toolchain. The toolchain refers to an AsciiDoc or DocBook deliverable publishable with it as a _title_, and this repo template adopts the same terminology.
//  FIXME: note that title is also the name of a top-level directory that contains deliverables, each of which is defined by a master.adoc file in <titles>/<title>/<distro> subdirectories, provided the name change from docs -> title happens.
distro::
		A _distro_ is shorthand for "distribution" and is similar to the concept of a Linux distribution such as Fedora. A Linux distro is a customized "spin" of the Linux kernel along with a customized userland . A _distro_ for our purposes is a certain set of docs that is released under a certain downstream product or upstream project name.
topic::
  A _topic_ is considered to be an atomic chunk of content contained within a single file. It may or may not be self-contained. In the future, it is likely to adhere to a content model such as concept, task or reference.
		
== Properties of *{RepoTemplateCodeName} *

This template repository structure has the following properties:

This repository structure has the following properties:

* It is verified to work with the Tooling team's Docs2Drupal (and soon Docs 2.0) publication systems.
//* It is verified that repositories in this format can be localized without issues.
* It is based on the "library," or "multi-title" repo model. This repository structure can work with any number of titles, from one to whatever.
* The repository structure serves to make it clear which content—usually toics—is/are shared between different distributions ("distros") of a title, shared between more that one title, or potentially local to a single distro of a title.
* The need to use file-naming conventions to signify levels of sharing (a.k.a. "Hungarian notation") is reduced due to the directory structure making it more explicit.
* It can be mirrored between Github and Gitlab by the Tooling team.
* Content from other repositories can be pulled into this one using the Git subtree (or Git submodels if absolutely necessary).
* This repository structure has been structured so that it works with discrete chunks of content included from the `topics` and `topics/shared` subdirectories of each title. That is, it is based on, and will work best with, a _topic-oriented_ content development model.

In addition, this repository structure has been designed to work with the following content development models:

* All content development is performed in the Github repository, for any number of titles and distros, provided that release versions are more-or-less in sync between those distros. The Github repository is mirrored to Gitlab solely in order to publish using the Docs2Drupal/Docs 2.0 toolchain (i.e. Pantheon).
* Upstream content development  (by engineering, community members, etc.), for any number of titles and distros, happens in Github. Downstream development (by CCS, engineering), for any number of titles and distros, happens in Gitlab.
* All content development for any number of titles and distros happens in Gitlab.
* This repository structure is extremely flexible and should be able to account for any other development models. Contact mailto:dhensley@redhat.com[Silas] or if you have any questions about whether this repository structure can work for your project.

== How to Use This Repository Template

1. Clone this repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/silasrh/multi-topic-level-repo-template.git
    
2. Delete the `.git` directory. 

Important: in most circumstances, deleting a .git directory is a really bad idea and not what you want to do. However, because this Git template repository is only intended to provide a certain directory structure, and its history is completely useless to projects which use it, it is permissible to delete the .git directory in this case, as an exception to the general rule. If you don't delete it, the history of the template repository will become part of your project's history, which probably isn't want you want.

    $ cd multi-topic-level-repo-template
    $ rm .git -fr
    
3. Modify the global attributes in `docs/shared/attributes.adoc` for your project.

4. Make modifications to the first title:
    1. Copy the entire `docs/my-title-a` directory and its contents to `docs/_<your_actual_first_title_name>_`. 
    2. Rename the `enterprise` and `upstream-1` directories to match the names of your distros.
    3. Define the *my-title-a* and *product-build* attributes in `master.adoc`.
    Ensure the first title builds after the modifications and then repeat these steps for each additional title.
    
5. Remove any directories for distros that you have not customized for your project:
		* Under `docs/`, delete the directories for any titles that you do not require, such as `my-title-b` if you do not have a second title. This helps to avoid confusion. Note that these template directories can always be copied from this repository in the future, if needed.
  * Under `docs/_<titles>_/`, delete the directories for any distros that you do not require, such as `upstream-1` if you do not have an upstream. This helps to avoid confusion. Note that these template directories can always be copied from this repository in the future, if needed.
    
6. If you are migrating existing content to this repository template, it is recommended to put all content into the `topics` directories for the appropriate titles, even if the content *is not* shared between distros. (There are more reasons for putting content that isn't shared between distros of a title or multiple titles into the `_<title>_/topics` directory, at least at first, but they are beyond the scope of this README. For a discussion of the reasoning, which touches on content development workflow, contact mailto:dhensley@redhat.com[Silas].)

7. Remove this README.adoc file, or overwrite it with the details for your project! Do not leave this README as-is for your project!

8. TBD: Full instructions should be provided for hooking this repository up to Pantheon. In short:
  * You must set the Content Directory for each book to <docs>/<title>

Fix buildGuides.sh to work with multi-topic-level and re-include this info

### Build the Example Books

To build all of the example books, open a terminal, navigate to the root directory of this repository, and type the following command:

        $ scripts/buildGuides.sh

The script provides links to both AsciiDoctor and ccutil builds for each of the example books. Look at the rendered HTML to see how the preprocessor directives work to conditionally display content.

You can also build a single guide. Navigate to the folder of the book you want to build and type the following command:

        $ ./buildGuide.sh

### Modify the Example Books for Your Documentation

Copy the structure into your own local repository and make the following changes to customize this template for your implementation.

1. Add your Asciidoc `*.adoc` files to the `topics/` folder.
2. Replace the values in the `docs/shared/attributes.adoc` file for your documentation.
  * Replace the product names and releases.
  * Replace the book names.
3. Use 'git mv' to rename the book folder names.

        $ cd my-title-a
        $ git mv my-title-a Installation_Guide.
4. In a terminal, navigate to each book folder and add the symlink to the `topics/` using this command:

        $ ln -s ../topics topics
5. Within each book folder, modify the `master-docinfo.xml` file to set the appropriate title, product, release, and other values for the build of the book to the portal.
6. Within each book folder, modify the `master.adoc` file to set the appropriate title, document attributes, and include the appropriate `topics/` content.
7. When you are ready, run the scripts to build the guides and review the output to make sure it looks correct.

### {RepoTemplateCodeName} Revision History

1.0::
  * rename `My_Title_A`, `My_Title_B` and `Upstream_1` directories to `my-title-a`, `my-title-b` and `upstream-1` naming patterns to make navigating the Git repo as fast as possible.
  * `docs/shared/templates/document-attributes.adoc` moved to `docs/shared/attributes.adoc`.
  * all includes of `document-attributes.adoc` changed to corr  ect for new attributes.adoc location.
  * `scripts/buildGuides.sh` moved to `resources/scripts/buildGuides.sh`.
  * latest version of the EAP team's `asciidoc-writing-guide.adoc` added to the `resources` directory for referential convenience.
  * RepoTemplateVersion and RepoTemplateCodeName attributes defined in `docs/shared/attributes.adoc`.
  * remove `topic-6` and `topic-7` because they are unnecessary for illustrative purposes.
Pre-1.0::
	* contains typo in repository structure diagram: "images — This folder contains all imagess"
	* `buildGuides.sh` (98 lines, 86 sloc) does not work correctly because it had not been updated from the script developed by EAP
