== Using the Repository

=== Downstream and Upstream

The downstream folder is _rhmap_.

The upstream folder is _upstream-1_.

The _topics_ folder contains *.adoc* files which are shared between the _rhmap_ and _upstream-1_ folder.

The _rhmap_ and _upstream-1_ folder have access to the _topics_ folder via a symbolic link.

To best understand the information above, see the example located in the repo.

=== Books, Chapters, User Stories and Modular Docs

The _rhmap_ and _upstream-1_ folder posses their own version of the *master.adoc* file - this is the Book.

The Chapters are found within the Book (*master.adoc*).
They are simply headings.
Each Chapter will contain one to many User Stories.

In *master.adoc*, the User Stories are formed using references to Modular Doc *.adoc* files.
The structure of the User Story is defined with headings and the structure is based on an link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs/tree/master/files[Assembly template(TEMPLATE_ASSEMBLY.adoc)].

Modular Docs are *.adoc* files and contain the content and are primarily located in the _topics_ folder.
Modular Docs are imported into the User Stories.
There are 3 types of Modular Docs:

.  link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs/tree/master/files[Concept template (TEMPLATE_CONCEPT_concept_template_and_guidelines.adoc)]
.  link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs/tree/master/files[Procedure template (TEMPLATE_PROCEDURE_doing_one_procedure.adoc)]
.  link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs/tree/master/files[Reference template(TEMPLATE_REFERENCE_reference_template_and_guidelines.adoc)]

To best understand the information above, see the example located in the repo.

== Building the Community Edition

The *master.adoc* file is the only file to build when rendering the files into text.
Build the example located in the _upstream-1_ folder:

    gem install asciidoctor
    git checkout gh-pages
    cd docs/workforce-management-framework/upstream-1
    asciidoctor master.adoc
    cp master.html ../../../index.html
    git commit -a -m"Pages update"
    git push origin +gh-pages
    
=== Creating References to Anchors

An anchor (for example: [[Testing the App]]) cannot appear more than once in an *.adoc* file.
As Modular Doc files are regularly reused in the same *.adoc* file, this results in a build error.
See link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#include-multiple[Including Multiple Anchors] to negate this issue.

To best understand the information above, see the example located in the repo.

=== Writing a User Story, *not* a Feature

IMPORTANT: It is vital that content is created with a User Story in mind

A Feature describes all available features - it is comprehensive.

A User Story explains how to achieve a specific goal - it is selective.

In a user story-based world, docs describe, for example, how to make an omelette (using onions and eggs).

* Making an Onion Omelette
. Setting up Workplace
. Preparing Ingredients
. Selecting Spices
. Combining Ingredients
. Frying Omelette Mixture
. Serving the Omelette
. Other Onion Recipes

A User Story is created using the 3 types of Modular Docs:

.  link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs/tree/master/files[Concept template (TEMPLATE_CONCEPT_concept_template_and_guidelines.adoc)]
.  link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs/tree/master/files[Procedure template (TEMPLATE_PROCEDURE_doing_one_procedure.adoc)]
.  link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs/tree/master/files[Reference template(TEMPLATE_REFERENCE_reference_template_and_guidelines.adoc)]

To best understand the information above, see the example located in the repo.
